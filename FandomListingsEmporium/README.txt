When I get a passion for a new fandom, pairing, band, television show, movie, character, etc., I usually make an addition about it here in what was originally a Livejournal entry about such that became of rather extraordinary length and needed rather some organization after a time.

I decided to make it as well-done-so as possible, by including the paragraph align multi-script anchor links and extensive tags, as well as subsecting it into various fandoms and, again - alphabetically, after that.  All told, it rather took a long time, but was - like when I wrote the <a href="http://angelfirenze.livejournal.com/45559.html" target="_blank">fandom collection</a> entry - manhours well spent, in my view, and continue to be whenever I update it.

Since I found the editor, obviously, I'll just include that I've changed some terminology to be more correct and up-to-date, as well as loading the public Livejournal entry link for the repository in question's origins.
