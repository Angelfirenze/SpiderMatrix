Along came a Spider-Man and sat down beside his older half-brother, The One.  

They have lessons to teach each other. Once freed, it is discovered immediately that Peter still retains his Spider
powers and during his first introduction to the Jump program, due to his experimentation while plugged in, he has no falling injuries, but instead immediately grasps the side of the opposite building, proceeding to climb all the way to the roof, shocking everyone on the rebuilt ship, the Nebuchadnezzar, much less the Council, and certainly Jason Lock.  

He is eighteen and eligible to join Neo and Trinity, who pieced together that the machines, having sensed Neo and Trinity's part machine make-up, assembled their bodies and Neo's mind and fitted them with prostheses in Trinity's case, regarding her wounds and rebooted Neo and Trinity's mind is rebooted like a crashed computer and her injuries covered with protective metal mesh underneath her restored skin.  All this is done as recompense for Neo corrupting and cleaning the Smith program before permanently recycling it.  

The Machines officially agree to a conditional cease-fire where Zion recognizes their ancestors' part in the lead-up to the War.  Machines cease attacking hoverships.   Humans and machines share information about rogue viruses and spyware that likely will still plague both sides.

** This project served as a fantastic tool for learning how to use GitExtensions on Windows.  I will try to tailor it or similar ideas to other GUIs, such as Tower for Mac, SourceTree, et cetera.

If at all possible, I will create a version for the purpose of refining my skills with the command-line interface.
