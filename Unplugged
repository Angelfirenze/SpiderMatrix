Since there seems to be some doubt on my Git GUI and Bash that my work exists at all, I suppose it would be appropriate considering the canon for this part of the hybrid between The Matrix Trilogy and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) is based upon an imaginary universe supplanting our actual memories while we incubate our entire lives in pods, being fed upon as energy grown out of the desire for control by electrical conduits not unlike ourselves, with the difference of artificial intelligence.

I should note that I have watched the entirety of the Matrix trilogy, as well as the interweaving of The Animatrix into the two latter films' plotlines.  I suppose I'm going to have to do what Neo asks Kid and save myself from having to redo this entire project out of sheer frustration.

If I cannot write and push/clone the originals on Github for Windows, then I shall do all original programming here on Github and, after regaining access to Photoshop, any other imaging work on my hard drive to be inserted later on with the help of Photobucket, which luckily exists for purposes like these.
